=begin

Write a Perl script that will perform basic validation and formatting of UK postcodes.
The postcodes are to be read from standard input, or from a file specified at the
command line (use while (<>){â€¦}). The input lines are only to contain a
postcode, with no other text, and blank lines should be ignored.
The format of a UK postcode is as follows:
One or two uppercase alphabetic characters
followed by: between one and two digits
followed by: an optional single uppercase alphabetic character
followed by: a single space
followed by: a single digit
followed by: two uppercase alphabetic characters
Alphabetic characters are those in the range A-Z.
The following formatting is to be done:
Remove all tabs and spaces
Convert to uppercase
Insert a space before the final digit and 2 letters
Print out all the reformatted postcodes, indicating which are in error, and a count of
valid and invalid codes at the end.
Test your program using the file postcodes.txt in the labsolutions directory.
Hints:
Keep it simple; don't try to do all the formatting on one line of code!
Do the formatting first, and then test the resulting pattern
The test file has 25 valid and 5 invalid postcodes.
