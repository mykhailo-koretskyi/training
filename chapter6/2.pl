=begin

Write a program that prompts the user for a word, then prints it 5 times on one line.
The program should then ask the user for another word, which it prints 5 times again.
Keep looping until the user enters the word `quit` (don't worry if 'quit' is also printed).
Hint: after reading from the keyboard, donâ€™t forget to chomp.

my $salida = '';
while ($salida ne 'quit') {
	print "Entar a word, 'quit' to stop: ";
	$salida = <STDIN>;
	chomp $salida;
	print $salida x 5, "\n";
}
