=begin

The object of this exercise is to construct an array of arrays which stores details of
files. The array is to be constructed as follows:
index 0 1 2 3
0 Filename Mode Size Date last modified
1 Filename Mode Size Date last modified
2 Filename Mode Size Date last modified
n etcâ€¦
The Perl stat command takes a filename (or handle) as an argument, and returns a
list of file attributes. The elements of interest are:
element index value
2 mode, which includes type and permissions as a bit mask
7 size in bytes
9 time last modified (in seconds since epoc)
Obtain a list of filenames, we suggest all the Perl scripts in the current directory using
glob. Now call stat on each one (stat filename), storing the required data in a
multi-dimensional array.
Finally print the resulting array of arrays. Some formatting is required for the raw
data, as follows:
mode convert the permissions to octal using:
printf "%lo", mode & 07777
time last modified convert to a readable date/time using:
scalar(localtime(mtime))
You might find that printf is the simplest way of printing each record. Your output
should look something like this:

Note that on Microsoft Windows the permissions will probably be 666 (rw-rw-rw-).
